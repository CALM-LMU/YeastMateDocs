# How to use the YeastMate Fiji plugin

You can download the Fiji plugin from https://github.com/hoerlteam/FijiYeastMate/releases. Just put the single ```.jar``` file into the ```plugins``` folder of you Fiji installation and YeastMate should appear under ```Plugins->YeastMate``` the next time you start Fiji.

The Fiji plugin requires a running instance of the detection backend. You can start the packaged detection backend from within the GUI or directly start it with the yeastmate_server executable in the YeastMate installation folder in ```resources->python->YeastMate```. 

Alternatively, you can start the detection backend from the command line with ```python yeastmate_server.py``` after setting up the required Python environment as described in .
