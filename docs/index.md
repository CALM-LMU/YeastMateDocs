YeastMate is a tool for the automated detection and segmentation of *S. cerevisae* cells and their mating events. It can detect

* single yeast cells
* mating events
* budding events

as well as a subclassification of these events into mother and daughter cells.

YeastMate uses a modified Mask R-CNN neural network for detection and segmentation and comes with a user interface and prepackaged one-click installer without the need for Python or other dependencies. 

A FIJI plugin is available to facilitate integration etc...
